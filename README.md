| Task   |  Implement authentication   |

# Technologies

For this task, I will use PHP, MySQL, and Google Auth library.

# Task details

The purpose of the laboratory work #4 is to add authentication functionality using both password and Google Auth.

# How to run the project

You can access the website using this [link](https://personweblpnu.000webhostapp.com/). *Note that the Google Auth doesn't work there because of the hosting service restrictions (everything works fine on local server).*

Alternatively, you can download the repository and run it locally via XAMPP.
