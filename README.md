# Task details

The purpose of the laboratory work #4 is to add authentication functionality using both password and Google Auth.

# How to run the project

You can access the website using this [link](https://personweblpnu.000webhostapp.com/). Note that the Google Auth doesn't work there because of hosting restrictions (but it works fine on local server).

Alternatively, you can download the repository and run it locally via XAMPP.
